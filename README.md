Abstract

In this thesis, a complete note onset estimation and pitch detection system is
presented, tuned for guitar music signals. The goal of this system is to 
estimate the point in time that a single note was played and then attribute
a frequency to it. This task is then extended to a sequence of played notes.
Various onset and pitch estimation algorithms were tested and compared,
taking into account both their effciency to complete the task, accurate tran-
sciption of the signal, as well as their computational complexity timewise,
thus achieving processing time less than or equal to the duration of the mu-
sic signal.
